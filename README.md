## overview

librealt is an open-source toolkit that **scans installed applications on your device** and shows fully **libre or FOSS alternatives**. it works on **android, ios, windows, and linux**, helping users replace proprietary software with open-source options while keeping data local and privacy-respecting.

it’s designed for anyone who wants to **take control of their software choices** and support the libre software ecosystem.

## the problem

most apps today track user activity, collect personal data, or lock features behind proprietary code. users often don’t know which apps could be replaced with libre alternatives. librealt solves this problem by providing a **local, transparent way** to see which apps on your device have open-source replacements, giving you control and freedom over your digital life.
