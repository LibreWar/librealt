librealt — cross-platform FOSS / libre app scanner

librealt is an open-source toolkit that scans the apps installed on your device and shows which ones have fully libre or FOSS alternatives. it works on android, ios, windows, and linux, helping users discover open-source replacements for proprietary software without any guesswork.


---

why librealt

many apps today track your data or hide features behind closed code. librealt gives you a local, privacy-respecting way to see which apps on your device can be replaced with open-source alternatives. everything runs locally, nothing is sent online, and the database is updated regularly by the community.
